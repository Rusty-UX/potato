When I started working at Shopify over two years ago, the first thing I saw on my way into the office after leaving the elevator was this beautiful illuminated illustration of this space-woman greeting you, and welcoming you to the Shopify Mothership. It gave off such a cool vibe on your way in, and makes you appreciate that you’re somewhere special. There was such a contrast between the sketchy exterior of the building and hallway on the first floor, compared with the office. Shopify has since moved from that office, along with the sign to 150 Elgin street.

When I was asked if I could create a piece for the Cafe at the office, I was really excited. Not just tonnes of Shopifolk come through the Cafe everyday on there way to their desks, but also for any guests that are around for events.

It was important that whatever we put on this wall, it had to make people feel welcome, and serve as a introduction to Shopify, in the same way that the illustration of the space woman did.

When we first started thinking about the design of the wall, we gathered a lot of reference material. Originally we focused on very ornamental or floral typography, which fit well with the Café. After a while of exploring, we decided that we'd echo the message now on the 8th floor— Welcome to the Shopify Mothership. Once we had that down the direction changed. It became focused, and knew that the ornamental floral look wouldn't work. It wouldn't support the message.

We realized that we'd need to build the layout in single colour (white on black) and so the details had to all work in single colour. We focused on finding a layout and style that worked well with the dimensions of the chalk wall (12 x 10 feet).

Konval and I decided that this message was to be the focus of the piece.
