When I started working at Shopify about two years ago, the first thing I saw on my way into the office after leaving the elevator was this beautiful illuminated illustration of this space-woman greeting you, and welcoming you to the Shopify Mothership. It gave off such a cool vibe on your way in, and makes you appreciate that you’re somewhere special. There was such a contrast between the sketchy exterior of the building and hallway on the first floor, compared with the office. Shopify has since moved from that office, along with the sign to 150 Elgin street.

When I was asked if I could create a piece for the Café at the office, I was really excited. Not just tonnes of Shopifolk come through the Cafe everyday on there way to their desks, but also for any guests that are around for events.

It was important that whatever we put on this wall, it had to make people feel welcome, and serve as a introduction to Shopify, in the same way that the illustration of the space woman did. After a while of exploring, we decided that we'd echo the message now on the 8th floor— Welcome to the Shopify Mothership.

## Early concepts
We realized that we'd need to build the layout in single colour (white on black) and so the details had to all work in single colour. We focused on finding a layout and style that worked well with the dimensions of the chalk wall (12 x 10 feet).

Since the wall had already been painted with blackboard paint it was decided that we'd need chalk. I'd done a bit of work in the past with chalk markers and really enjoyed the clean lines you could get that just aren't possible with regular chalk. They are a bit on the pricey side, but each one goes a long way, I only went through one doing the whole wall. You can pick some up here.

## Inspiration
To get an idea of style I did a lot of research into the materials that go into a space shuttle. I started out by exploring Café sandwich boards, and sign paintings but it became clear that the style wouldn't match the message. I looked for reference material that was a bit closer to the message.

That's when I found NASA patches! NASA has always had these really great patches that are worn on missions. It's really amazing how diverse they are, considering the subject matter is often so similar (A spaceship, space, and usually the ISS in the background). When I found this patch, I knew that this was going to be a big point of inspiration.

Since this was going to be such a large piece, I decided to design the layout and overall shape digitally, rather than figure out all the dimensions by hand. Purists might be disappointed, but it allowed me to figure out size, shape and flow in a way that wouldn't have otherwise been possible.
